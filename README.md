# SamplePHP-API
This is a sample PHP project to create API using native PHP for speed development.

It has 4 files.
1. Rest.inc.php - is where you define the Rest functions together with rest response code.
2. conf.inc.php - is used to define your db connection and any other connection used by the API
3. ht.htaccess - you need to  rename the file to '.htaccess'. It is used by the webserver to manage the access on the API
4. Sample.php - the filename must be the same as the name defined in '.htaccess' file.
